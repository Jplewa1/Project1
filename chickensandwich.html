  <h1>The Battle of the Chicken Sandwiches</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>As we know, in the recent years there has been rising attention to the legendary meal that is the <strong>Chicken Sandwich</strong>. In this webpage we will be exploring four sandwiches that I have chosen to be the best on the parameters of, easy to acquire, cheapness, taste, and quality. Those four sandwiches are McDonald's Chicken Sandwich, Chick-Fil-A Chicken Sandwich, KFC Chicken Sandwich, and the Popeyes Chicken Sandwich.<p>
